I've starte dto write this eBook in September 2017. It seems work is done in a very irregular way. Sometimes I have a few days or a week in a row that I manage to work on the book and then a few week or even month of other tasks.

In other words, it is making progress, but it is slower than I expected.

See the [changes](#changes) section if you'd like to know more about the progress.

OK, but when will the book be finished?

Probably never.

I'll probably keep tweaing it and adding new content to it for a long time.

However it certainly covers most if not all that you need.

So here is what I suggest:

Start reading the book and start writing your Dancer-based web application. If you get stuck and the book does not give you answer how to continute, get in touch with me the same way as you'd [report a bug](#bug-reporting) in the book. If you describe your situation in a way that I can understand, I'll do my best to give you some help.
