I've started to write this eBook in September 2017. It seems work is done in a very irregular way. Sometimes I have a few days or a week in a row that I manage to work on the book and then a few week or even month of other tasks.

In other words, it is making progress, but it is slower than I expected.

See the [changes](#changes) section if you'd like to know more about the progress.

**OK, but when will the book be finished?**

Between you and me?

I don't know.

When is a piece of software finished?

It is a never ending story. We can always fix some bugs and add some features. Especially that the world around us changes. So do the requirements.

If I was using a traditional publishing house and if I was planning to cerate a printed version of the book I might really need to stop working on it at one point. But give that I am using Leanpub, I can keep tweaking it and adding new content to it for an infinite time. Give or take a few years. You will always have access to the most recent edition of the eBook.

**So here is what I suggest:**

Start reading the book and** start writing your Dancer-based web application. If you get stuck and the book does not give you an answer how to continue, get in touch with me the same way as you'd [report a bug](#bug-reporting) in the book. I'll do my best to give you some help.
