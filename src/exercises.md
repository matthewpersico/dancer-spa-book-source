# Exercises

Reading a book is nice, but if you'd really like to learn how to build something you need to get your hands dirty. So as soon as possible you need to start implementing whatever you learned. The best might be to start building a project yourself. In any case I'll provide a few exercises that will make use of the things you might have already encountered in the book. If you need help you can always check out the various [support channels](#support).

* Tic Tac Toe

[Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a very simple game for two players. First create a web application that will allow two players in front of the same browser to play the game. The browser will show who makes the next move. That person can then somehow indicate on which square she wants to place her x or o. The application verifies that it is a valid move. It checks if the game is ove or not and if it is over who won.
