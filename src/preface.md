# Preface {#preface}

Perl might not get much press these days, but 30 years after its first release it still has a significant developer community. There are countless organizations where Perl is used for mission critical applications. Every year there is a new release of Perl and CPAN is alive and kicking.

Unlike in 90's, these days there are many languages that can be used to do similar tasks to Perl. Each language with its own strength and weaknesses. One area that grew significantly is the writing of modern web-applications. Two significant new directions are Single Page Applications and Microservices. Interestingly they have a common attribute: They both need to have a well designed API over HTTP.

There are a number of modern frameworks that provide the foundation for that kind of work. Perl Dancer is one of them.

My hope is that by reading this book you will learn the basics of how to write modern Single Page Applications and Microservices. I cannot dream to provide an in-depth book about all the parts that are needed for either an SPA or a Microservice based architecture, but I'll do my best. If you follow along, by the end of the book you will be able to write your own SPA and create a Microservice using Perl Dancer. You will also know how to test these applications and how to deploy them.

This eBook is still in writing. Things will change. Your input is invaluable!

While in most of the book, including in the title, I use the name "Dancer", if I would like to be really exact, I should write Dancer2. Dancer2 is a rewrite of Dancer which is almost but not quite backword compatible. The main difference between the two is that Dancer2 is expected to be the future. If you are interested in the differences between the two, check out the [article written by Sawyer](http://advent.perldancer.org/2014/2).
