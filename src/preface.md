# Preface {#preface}

This is an early draft of the book. Don't expect anything.

This book is about the creation of Single Page Applications using Dancer2.

Dancer2 is a rewrite of Dancer. Throughout the book I'll use the name Dancer everywhere where Dancer2 except of the code examples where the name is critical.

If you are interested in the differences between the two, check out the [article written by Sawyer](http://advent.perldancer.org/2014/2).

Perl might not get much good press these days, but 30 years after its first release it still has a significant developer community. There are also countless organization where Perl is used for mission critical applications.

Unlike in 199x, these days Perl has a significant competition and thus Perl developers need to show how to write modern application using this language. On the Internet two significant new directions are Single Page Applications and Microservices. Interestingly they have a common attribute: They both need to have a well designed API over HTTPs.

There are a number of modern frameworks that provide the foundation for that kind of work. Perl Dancer is one of them.

My hope is that by reading this book you will learn at least the basics of how to write modern Single Page Applications and Microservices. Of course I cannot dream to provide an in-depth book about all the parts that are needed for either an SPA or a Microservice based architecture, but I'll do my best. My hope is that by the end of the book you will be able to write your own SPA and create a single Microservice.
