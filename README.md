# The source of the Dancer SPA book

## Test the examples

```
prove -r
```

## Update

Update the common articles from the common repository

```
./update
perl ../books/convert.pl
```

## TODO

Explain what is the "old way" when we return HTML pages and what is the Web 2.0 way or Asynchronous way where we send Ajax requests and get data
from the server.

Add exercises. Maybe even create Github repository with exercises.

Accessibility!

Explain selectors in jQuery.

## Off-line use of jQuery

TBD.
How to use jQuery so once the user has visited the site once she will be able to use our application even when she is off-line?
