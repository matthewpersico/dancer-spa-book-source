# Part 1 #

# Setup development environment {#setup-environment}

Before we can get started the development we need to set up our development environment. This might be a bit tedious task that stops us from the "real work", but in my experience investing in the development environment pays off.

Besides, without installing Dancer you won't be able to do much.

Nevertheless, if you are impatient, feel free to jump to the next chapter, read that and when you feel you need more setup come back here. The pages won't go anywhere.

We will describe how to set up your environment on Linux, OSX, and Windows. You'll learn how to install a virtual operating system using Virtualbox and Vagrant so you can use the best Linux-based environment even if your desktop computer is running Windows.

We learn how to install the latest version of Perl, and how to install perl modules from CPAN, including Dancer2 and a host of other modules we will need.

You will also get some recommendation regarding editors and IDEs you could use.
