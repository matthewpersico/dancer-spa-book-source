I've starte dto write this eBook in September 2017. It seems work is done in a very irregular way. Sometimes I have a few days or a week in a row that I manage to work on the book and then a few week or even month of other tasks.

In other words, it is making progress, but it is slower than I expected.

See the [changes](#changes) section if you'd like to know more about the progress.
