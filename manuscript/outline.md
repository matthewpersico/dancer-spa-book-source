## Outline {#outline}

This is the planned outline of the book.

### 1

Before we can start writing code we have a slightly tedious task of setting up our environment. That is installing Perl, Dancer2, and a few other things. If you are impatient feel free to skip this part and jump ahead. You can always come back and read the setup later.

### 2

While the main focus if the book is creating Single Page Applications, first we are going to see a few examples of building web applications where we server HTML pages.

In this chapter we will have our "Hello World" application in Dancer. We'll talk a bit about development environment.

### X

We go on building applications returning HTML pages. In this chapter we'll see an application with several pages.
We will see how to use the `template` function to combine an HTML template with some data.

We will see how to 

### X

We create the first "Hello World" as a SPA. This includes a simple AJAX requests to get some data from the server to the application

### X

We will see another SPA which is a bit more complex - a calculator that already accepts input from the user and provides some response. This includes a simple AJAX requests to send some data to the server, accept and process the response.

### X

We will create an application based on the skeleton provided by Dancer.

### X

In this chapter we will see how to deploy an application to a Virtual Private Server (VPS).

### X

Client side input validation can be used to improve usability. Without reaching the server and without incurring the delay caused by the network traffic we can check if the user has provided all the necessary input, if the input is in the expected format and/or in the expected value range.

### X

Server side input validation: While checking the input in the client can improve usability and the responsiveness of the web site, it cannot replace server side input validation. After all a person who might want to break in your service can circumvent the client side validation and send data directly to your back-end. You need to protect your service at that point.

### X

Server side error handling. What happens if there is an exception in the code?
What happens if the user tries to access a route without proper authentication?
What happens if the user does not supply the expected input, or supplies incorrect input? (e.g. a sting instead of a number).
What happens if the user tries to access a route that does not exist?

### X

When to use an SPA and when to avoid it, an SEO perspective.

* A simple route returning the HTML page that will house the rest of the application
* Introduction to Bootstrap, the HTML/CSS framework
* Creating content-heavy web pages for SEO

* Submitting data to the server and getting a response
* Client side error handling
* Designing and implementing an API
* Testing the back end API
* Pages: client side routing
* Submitting a form
