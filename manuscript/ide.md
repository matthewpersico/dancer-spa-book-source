## Editors and IDEs.

In training courses, where we don't have a lot of time to learn a new editor or IDE I usually recommend that people use whatever they are comfortable with.
This time however you might want to invest some more energy in learning an editor. After all you will spend a lot of time in front of it
and if it makes you more productive then the investment will pay off.

With that said I believe in the end there is no one correct editor or IDE. Some people feel comfortable with one, other with another solution.

### Any Platform

* [Vim or Gvim](http://www.vim.org/) can be used on any platform. It has a long learning curve, but once you got used to it, it can make you a lot more productive.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is another very powerful editor. It also has a long learning curve.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a lot more similar to plain text editors you might be used to. It can be extended by writing plugins in JavaScript.
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) with [EPIC](http://www.epic-ide.org/)
* [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)
* [Komodo IDE](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

### MS Windows

* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is an excellent generic editor with syntax highlighting and several usefule plugins.
* [UltraEdit](https://www.ultraedit.com/)

### Linux

* [Gedit](http://www.gedit.org) is a simple text editor.
* [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) is a very small and simple editor, but can be quite useful at time.
