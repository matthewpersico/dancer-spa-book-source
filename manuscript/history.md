# History of Dancer {#history}

The Perl Dancer project was created by Alexis Sukrieh in 2009 as a Perl clone of the Sinatra web framework written in Ruby.

The main advantage of these route-based frameworks was and still is simplicity in getting up and running.

After several years in use the core developers of Dancer arrived to the conclusion that in order to make progress they will need to make substantial changes to the framework.
Some of those are not going to be backward compatible. Because the way CPAN and the cpan clients work it is difficult to distribute two different production versions of a module,
the developers decided to use the name Dancer2 for the rewrite.
