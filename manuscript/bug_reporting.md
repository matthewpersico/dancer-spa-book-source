# Bug reporting {#bug-reporting}

If you encounter problems with the book, first please verify you are reading the most recent version of the book. Check the first page of the book you have for "This version was published on DATE" and compare it to the same line of the [Sample chapter](https://leanpub.com/dancer-spa) on the Leanpub web site.

If this is the latest version, then report the problem by sending an e-mail to me: Gabor Szabo <gabor@szabgab.com> with the following information:

1. The publish date of the book you are reading. You can find "This version was published on DATE" on the first internal page of the book.
1. What operating system do you use? (If Linux then which distribution, which version etc.?)
1. What did you do (list the commands and their output)?
1. What did you expected that did not happen?

If you encounter problems with Dancer2 itself, please visit the [GitHub repository of the Dancer2 project](https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2). There you'll find the "Issues". Check if the issue has been already reported. If it has, you are welcome to comment on the issue adding your report. If not, then please open a new issue. Here too, it would be useful to give the information listed above. You can leave the publishing date of the book out, as that is probably not relevant.
