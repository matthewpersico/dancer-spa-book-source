# Exercises

Reading a book is nice, but if you'd really like to learn how to build something you need to get your hands dirty. So as soon as possible you need to start implementing whatever you learned. The best might be to start building a project yourself. In any case I'll provide a few exercises that will make use of the things you might have already encountered in the book. If you need help you can always check out the various [support channels](#support).
