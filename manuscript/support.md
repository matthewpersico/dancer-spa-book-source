If you need support with Dancer you can get it in a number of channels.

There is a mailing list called dancer-users. You can find link to it on the [about](http://perldancer.org/about) page of the Perl Dancer web site. This is probably the best place if you have a question about Dancer. I am also lurking on this list so if something is unclear in the content of the book then feel free to ask there.

You can use IRC to chat with other Dancer developers. Connect to the #dancer channel on the irc.perl.org IRC server. You might use your own IRC client on your computer, or try this web based client: [Mibbit for Dancer](http://perldancer.org/irc).

[Perl Monks](http://www.perlmonks.org/) is the place to ask general Perl related questions.

Stack Overflow can be a good place to ask questions. Tag them with both [perl and dancer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dancer).

In order to get help with jQuery you can also use the [Stack Overflow with jquery](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jquery) tag.
