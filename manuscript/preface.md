# Warning

This is an early draft of the book. Don't expect anythig.

# Preface

This book is about the creation of Single Page Applications using Dancer2.

Dancer2 is a rewrite of Dancer. Throughout the book I'll use the name Dancer everywhere where Dancer2 except of the code examples where the name is critical.

If you are interested in the differences between the two, check out the [article written by Sawyer](http://advent.perldancer.org/2014/2).
