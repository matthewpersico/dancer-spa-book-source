# Preface

This book is about the creation of Single Page Applications using Dancer2.

Dancer2 is a rewrite of Dancer. Throughout the book I'll use the name Dancer everywhere even though I actually mean Dancer2.

If you are interested in the differences between the two, check out the [article written by Sawyer](http://advent.perldancer.org/2014/2).
